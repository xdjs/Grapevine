## 📊 Data Authenticity

This application prioritizes authentic music industry data:
- **No synthetic data**: Only real collaborations from verified sources
- **Two-tier fallback**: MusicBrainz → Wikipedia (no generated fallbacks)
- **Single artist display**: When no collaboration data exists, shows only the searched artist
- **Comprehensive debugging**: Detailed logging of data sources and extraction processes
