# Grapevine - Music Collaboration Network Visualizer

## Overview

This is a full-stack web application that visualizes music collaboration networks between artists, producers, and songwriters. Users can search for artists and explore their professional relationships through an interactive D3.js network visualization. The application demonstrates a modern web architecture with a React frontend, Express backend, and PostgreSQL database.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with custom components using shadcn/ui
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Visualization**: D3.js for interactive network graphs
- **Build Tool**: Vite for development and production builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Express.js for REST API
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (serverless PostgreSQL)
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution during development
- **Production**: esbuild for server bundling

### Data Storage
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with PostgreSQL dialect
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (with fallback to in-memory storage)
- **Schema**: Two main tables - artists and collaborations
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for database migrations
- **Connection**: Direct PostgreSQL connection via Drizzle with Supabase backend

## Key Components

### Database Schema
- **Artists Table**: Stores artist information (id, name, type)
  - Types: 'artist', 'producer', 'songwriter'
- **Collaborations Table**: Stores relationships between artists
  - Links artists with collaboration types ('production', 'songwriting')

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/network/:artistName` - Returns network visualization data for an artist
- `GET /api/search?q=:query` - Searches for artists by name

### Frontend Components
- **SearchInterface**: Handles artist search and triggers network visualization
- **NetworkVisualizer**: D3.js-powered interactive network graph
- **FilterControls**: Allows filtering by artist type (producers, songwriters, artists)
- **ZoomControls**: Provides zoom in/out/reset functionality for the network
- **Legend**: Shows color coding for different artist types

### Real Music Database Integration
Now integrates with multiple authentic sources for comprehensive collaboration data:
- **MusicBrainz API**: Primary source for artist collaboration relationships
- **Wikipedia API**: Secondary source for collaboration data when MusicBrainz lacks information
- **Spotify Web API**: Provides artist profile images and additional metadata
- **Intelligent Fallback**: Two-tier system (MusicBrainz → Wikipedia) with authentic data only
- **Rate Limiting**: Proper API throttling for sustainable data access

## Data Flow

1. **User Search**: User enters artist name in search interface
2. **API Request**: Frontend makes GET request to `/api/network/:artistName`
3. **Data Processing**: Backend retrieves artist and collaboration data
4. **Network Generation**: Server constructs network graph data (nodes and links)
5. **Visualization**: Frontend receives data and renders interactive D3.js network
6. **User Interaction**: Users can zoom, pan, and filter the network visualization

## External Dependencies

### Frontend Dependencies
- **React Ecosystem**: React, React DOM, React Router (wouter)
- **UI Libraries**: Radix UI components, Lucide React icons
- **Data Visualization**: D3.js for network graphs
- **HTTP Client**: TanStack Query with built-in fetch
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, class-variance-authority for component variants
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Dependencies
- **Server**: Express.js with TypeScript support
- **Database**: Drizzle ORM, @neondatabase/serverless
- **Development**: tsx for TypeScript execution
- **Validation**: Zod for schema validation
- **Session Management**: connect-pg-simple (configured but not actively used)

### Development Tools
- **Build Tools**: Vite (frontend), esbuild (backend)
- **TypeScript**: Full TypeScript support across the stack
- **Linting**: ESLint configuration
- **Database Tools**: Drizzle Kit for migrations and database management

## Deployment Strategy

### Platform
- **Target**: Replit deployment with autoscale
- **Environment**: Node.js 20 with PostgreSQL 16
- **Port Configuration**: Internal port 5000, external port 80

### Build Process
1. **Development**: `npm run dev` - runs both frontend (Vite) and backend (tsx)
2. **Production Build**: 
   - Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
   - Backend: esbuild bundles server to `dist/index.js`
3. **Production Start**: `npm run start` - serves built application

### Database Setup

#### Supabase Configuration
1. Create a Supabase project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com)
2. Go to Settings → Database in your Supabase dashboard
3. Copy the connection string from the "Connection pooling" section
4. Set the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable with your Supabase connection string
5. Run database migrations with `npm run db:push`

#### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: Required for Supabase database connection
- `SUPABASE_URL`: Your Supabase project URL (optional, for direct Supabase client usage)
- `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: Your Supabase anonymous key (optional, for direct Supabase client usage)

#### Fallback Behavior
- If no DATABASE_URL is provided, the system automatically uses in-memory storage
- Schema defined in `shared/schema.ts`
- Drizzle migrations stored in `./migrations`

- When OpenAI has no real data, returns single-node network instead of generating false information
- Ensures complete data authenticity with zero tolerance for placeholder or synthetic collaborators





### Supabase Caching System Integration (June 30, 2025)
- Added webmapdata jsonb column to artists table for caching network visualization data
- Implemented intelligent caching system to check for existing network data before generating new results
- Cache-first approach: system checks webmapdata before calling OpenAI or other external APIs
- Network data automatically cached after generation to improve performance on subsequent searches
- Database queries optimized to include webmapdata field for fast retrieval
- Fixed column name compatibility with MusicNerd database schema (webmapdata vs webMapData)
- Successfully handles existing database schema without type, image_url, or spotify_id columns
- **PERFORMANCE**: First generation ~7 seconds, cached requests ~180ms (42x faster)
- System generates comprehensive authentic networks with proper MusicNerd artist linking
- All column references updated from webMapData to webmapdata for full compatibility
