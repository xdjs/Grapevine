Please respond with JSON in this exact format:
{
  "collaborators": [
    {
      "name": "Person Name",
      "roles": ["producer", "songwriter"], 
      "topCollaborators": ["Artist 1", "Artist 2", "Artist 3"]

      "roles": ["songwriter"],
      "topCollaborators": ["Artist 1", "Artist 2", "Artist 3"]
    }
  ]
}

Important guidelines:
- Include up to 10 music industry professionals who have actually worked with ${artistName}
- For each person, list ALL their roles from: ["producer", "songwriter", "artist"]
- Many professionals have multiple roles (e.g., Jack Antonoff is both producer and songwriter)
- Include their top 3 collaborating artists for each person
- Focus on real, verified collaborations from the music industry`;
