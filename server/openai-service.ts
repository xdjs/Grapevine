IMPORTANT: If ${artistName} is not a well-known artist or you have no authentic collaboration data for them, return an empty collaborators array. Do NOT create fake or placeholder collaborators.

Please respond with JSON in this exact format:

      "roles": ["producer", "songwriter"], 
      "topCollaborators": ["Artist 1", "Artist 2", "Artist 3"]

  ]
}

Guidelines:
- Only include real, verified music industry professionals who have actually worked with ${artistName}
- If you don't have authentic data, return: {"collaborators": []}
- For each real person, list ALL their roles from: ["producer", "songwriter", "artist"]
- Include their top 3 real collaborating artists
- Never use generic names like "John Doe", "Producer X", or placeholder data
- Maximum 10 real collaborators if they exist`;
