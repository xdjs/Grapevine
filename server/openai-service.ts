- Producer-songwriter relationships across all career phases
- Cross-genre collaborations and experimental projects
- Earlier career work before mainstream success
- Regional/local music scene collaborations
- Remix work, features, and uncredited contributions

- Exact song titles they worked on together
- Specific albums or projects (include independent releases)
- How each person contributed to the collaboration
- What role each played (producer, songwriter, featured artist, engineer, etc.)

Include ALL authentic collaborations with specific song/album names when available. For smaller, independent, or emerging artists, include any known professional working relationships, studio sessions, or creative partnerships, even if less documented in mainstream sources.

- Cross-genre experiments and side projects
- Producer-songwriter relationships in various capacities
- Studio musicians and session work
- Remix collaborations and alternative versions
- Live performance collaborators
- Self-released or underground projects

IMPORTANT: Include both well-established industry figures AND smaller/independent collaborators who have worked with ${artistName}. Do NOT limit results to only mainstream collaborators.

If ${artistName} has limited mainstream recognition but has authentic music industry work, still provide any verified collaborators from their actual musical output.

Please respond with JSON in this exact format:

      "topCollaborators": ["Artist 1", "Artist 2", "Artist 3"]

Guidelines:
- Include real, verified music industry professionals who have actually worked with ${artistName}
- For smaller/independent artists, include collaborators even if documentation is limited
- If truly no authentic data exists, return: {"collaborators": []}
- For each real person, list ALL their roles from: ["producer", "songwriter", "artist"]
- Include their top 3 real collaborating artists (can include both mainstream and independent artists)
- Never use generic names like "John Doe", "Producer X", or placeholder data
- Maximum 15 real collaborators if they exist
- Prioritize quality and authenticity over quantity`;
